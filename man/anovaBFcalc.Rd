\title{This function computes Bayes factors from ANOVA summary statistics.}
\usage{
anovaBFcalc(F, df1, df2, repeated = FALSE, method = "BIC", alpha = -0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{F}{the observed F statistic}

\item{df1}{the between-treatments degrees of freedom}

\item{df2}{the residual degrees of freedom}

\item{repeated}{a logical indicating whether design is repeated
measures (TRUE) or between subjects (FALSE). Defaults to FALSE}

\item{method}{a string specifying "BIC" method of Kass and Raftery (1995)
or "MWS" method of Maruyama (2009) and Wang and Sun (2014).}

\item{alpha}{hyperparameter for scale of Pearson Type VI prior. Wang and Sun
recommend choosing alpha between -0.5 and 0. Defaults to -0.5, which 
provides asymptotic approximation to multivariate Cauchy prior.}
}
\description{
Currently, it employs two methods:
(1) the BIC method (Kass and Raftery, 1995), and
(2) the MWS method, based on methods of Maruyama (2009) 
and Wang and Sun (2014).
}
\details{
Minimally, the user must provide three inputs:
F = the observed F statistic
df1 = the "between-treatments" degrees of freedom
df2 = the residual degrees of freedom

The function gives BF_10 as an output.

Additional options may be specified -- see below

\examples{
## using BIC approximation
## between subjects design, observed F(3,96) = 2.76
anovaBFcalc(F=2.76, df1=3, df2=96)

## repeated measures design, observed F(1,22) = 1.336
anovaBFcalc(F=1.336, df1=1, df2=22, repeated=TRUE)

## using MWS method with alpha = -0.5 (default)
## observed F(2,15) = 7.16
anovaBFcalc(F=7.16, df1=2, df2=15, method="MWS")

## using alpha=0
anovaBFcalc(F=7.16, df1=2, df2=15, method="MWS", alpha=0)
