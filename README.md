# anovaBFcalc

This is a Shiny app that is designed to calculate Bayes factors from minimal ANOVA summaries (i.e., the F statistic and the degrees of freedom of the test).  Its use is described in the upcoming paper "Estimating evidential value from ANOVA summaries: A comment on Ly et al. (2018)", in press at *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science*.
