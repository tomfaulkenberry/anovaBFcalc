# ANOVA Bayes Factor Calculator

`anovaBFcalc` is a Shiny app that is designed to calculate Bayes factors from minimal ANOVA summary statistics (i.e., the F statistic and the degrees of freedom of the test).  Its use is described in the paper "Estimating evidential value from ANOVA summaries: A comment on Ly et al. (2018)", published in *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science*.
